                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
                Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research.
                Education frequently
                takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves.[1] Education
                can take place
                in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks,
                feels, or acts may
                be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.education in zambia</p>

                not make education available in their countries, or because their families do not have enough money, or

            <p class="subsectionTab text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their
                society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed
                knowledge,
                values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond
                skills that could
                be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time
                of the Middle
                Kingdom.</p>
